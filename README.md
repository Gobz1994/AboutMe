# AboutMe

-____ Just a little bit about me! :) ____-

At the moment, I work as a crypto, NFT, and stock trader during the day and as a side hustler at night.

In 2018, I earned my technical software support specialist diploma from Mohawk College Applied Art.

In 2019, I founded an e-commerce marketplace mobile application company called "Often Deals" that would give local businesses the ability to post their products and services on the app and cut commission fees competitors charge to provide the same services.

by June 2020, Often Deals had already failed and I got into a $17,000 debt. A friend introduced me to Crypto Blockchains and NFT flipping, and six months later,  I successfully flipped $3410 to nearly quarter a million in 8 months.


In 2021, I decided to explore different career options and fell in love with data analytics and data science and decided. I took a course in machine learning, NLP and AI, and later on Google Data Analytics course and I love it!

In 2022, I am hoping I could land a job in Data Analytics in the Finanical, Government or Technology Industries. As well, improve my analytical and technical skills I am ready anyways!
